# Programming in Science - Lab 4

This template repository is the starter project for Programming in Science Lab 4. Written in Python, and tested with Pytest.

### Question(s) Weekdays and Weekends
 * The proper day number of a week must be between 1 and 7.
 * If the day number is 1, then day name is "Monday" and if the day number is 7, then day name is "Sunday" and so on.
 * Any day from Monday to Friday is a Weekday and any day from Saturday to Sunday is Weekend.  

**Q1: Weekday or Weekend**. 
* Write a program to check if the given number is proper day number and if it is, then for the given day number, your program should tell if it is about Weekday or Weekend.
* If the given number is not a proper day number, return message "Not a proper day number!"
  * Input 0 ==> output "Not a proper day number!"
  * Input 2 ==> output "It is a Weekday!"
  * Input 6 ==> output "It is a Weekend!"
 
**Q2: Get Day Name**. 
* Write a program to check if the given number is proper day number and if it is, then for the given day number, your program should tell what day it is ("Monday" or "Wednesday").
* If the given number is not a proper day number, return message "Not a proper day number!"
  * Input 8 ==> output "Not a proper day number!"
  * Input 2 ==> output "It is a Tuesday!"

**Q3: Get Letter Grade**
* Write a program that checks whether an entered mark is a proper percentage mark (0–100).
* If valid, return its letter grade from the scale:
  * A: 90–100 (Excellent)
  * B: 80–89 (Good)
  * C: 70–79 (Average)
  * D: 60–69 (Minimal pass)
  * F: Below 60 (Fail)

* If invalid, output: "Not a proper mark!"

* Sample Input/Output:
  * Input: 92 → Output: "A"
  * Input: 111 → Output: "Not a proper mark!"
